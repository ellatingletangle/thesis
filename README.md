# Thesis
All the stuff for my master's thesis 

This repository contains my coded data of the German Cannabis legalizaiton debate. The software I used for coding the text data was Discoruse Network Analyser. To open the data some form of this software needs to be installed and can be found on ttps://github.com/leifeld/dna. The version I used was dna_2.0-beta25.jar because this is the only version currently with a running R Package. All subsequent analyses were done in R. The code for this can also be found here.
